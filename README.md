### SFP, the Simple Forecasting Platform

Live demo at [http://simplefcast.swift.pw/](http://simplefcast.swift.pw/)

A very simple forecast elicitation platform inspired by work with the [Good Judgment Project](http://goodjudgmentproject.com).

The purpose was to allow users to browse a set of forecast questions, make repeated probabilistic forecasts on them, and to see the history of those forecasts.

Note the slider UI which allows entry of multiple probabilities which must sum to 1 across 2 or more response categories.  The sliders extend [noUiSlider](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/)

Developed in less than a week after work using all of the coolest ready to go web dev packages I could get my hands on

* Composer
* Laravel
* MySQL
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
